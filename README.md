# Analysis of Virtualization-based Obfuscation

This repository contains slides, samples and code of the 4h code deobfuscation workshop at [r2con2021](https://rada.re/con/2021/). We give a brief introduction into virtualization-based obfuscation and manually analyze a simple VM generated by [`Tigress`](https://tigress.wtf/). Afterward, we use symbolic execution to automate the analysis and write a dynamic VM disassembler that is based on [`Miasm`](https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm). 

The recording will be available soon.
